# AI Website Summarizer

This summarizer uses OpenAI gpt-4o-mini to summarize the content of any given url, returning in a markdown format. You can user it in jupyter notebooks (and for that, you'll need to uncomment line 85). Otherwise, it will print on your console the summary in markdown notation. 

Have fun!
